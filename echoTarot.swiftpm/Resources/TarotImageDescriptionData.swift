        "major-00": "The background of this card is a bright, solid yellow sky. In the top right corner, a large white sun is shining brightly. This radiant sky represents the positive energy of a brand new journey. In the center, a young man is standing right on the edge of a steep cliff. His head is lifted high, looking up at the sky instead of the dangerous drop below. This posture shows his absolute freedom and fearlessness. He is wearing a colorful tunic patterned with red flowers, and yellow boots. In his right hand, he holds a wooden wand resting on his shoulder, with a small bag tied to the end. This tiny bag symbolizes the minimal experience he carries with him. In his left hand, he delicately holds a single white rose. The white rose stands for his pure and innocent heart. At his feet, in the bottom left, a small white dog is jumping up with its front paws raised. This dog acts as a companion and a warning of the dangers ahead. Behind the cliff, tall white snow-capped mountains stretch across the horizon. These cold mountains imply that the upcoming journey will have its challenges.",
        "major-01": "In the center stands a young, confident man. Above his head floats a yellow infinity symbol, shaped like a figure eight on its side. This symbolizes his infinite potential. He wears a pure white tunic underneath a bright red cloak. These colors represent a mix of pure intentions and strong willpower. Around his waist, a snake is biting its own tail to form a belt. This is an ancient symbol of eternity and infinite wisdom. His right arm is raised to the sky, holding a double-ended white wand, while his left hand points straight down to the ground. This specific pose means he is pulling spiritual energy from above and bringing it into the physical world below. Right in front of him is a square wooden table. On this table, there is a wooden wand, a golden cup, a silver sword, and a coin with a star on it. These objects represent the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth, showing that he has all the tools he needs. The top and bottom borders of the card are framed with blooming red roses and white lilies. These flowers represent the harmony between human desires and a pure soul.",
        "major-02": "In the very center, a quiet and mysterious woman sits between two massive pillars. She wears a flowing blue robe that covers her body and head, with a large white cross on her chest. The cross represents perfect balance. On her head is a silver crown featuring a full moon with crescent moons on both sides. This crown identifies her as a ruler of intuition and the subconscious. In her lap rests a scroll with the word TORA written on it. The scroll is half-hidden inside her blue robe. This hidden scroll suggests that the ultimate truth is a secret, revealed only to those who are ready. At her feet lies a thin yellow crescent moon, and the fabric of her dress flows down like water. These elements further connect her to the subconscious mind. Looking at the two pillars beside her, the left one is entirely black with a white letter B. The right pillar is white with a black letter J. Together, they represent the duality of the world, like darkness and light. Behind her, a colorful tapestry hangs between the pillars, blocking the view. It is decorated with a pattern of pomegranates and palm leaves. This tapestry symbolizes the rich, hidden depths of the inner world.",
        "major-03": "The scene is filled with warm yellow light and lush nature. In the center, a woman sits comfortably on a large throne covered with plush red cushions. She has a full, relaxed figure and appears to be pregnant. She is wearing a loose white dress covered in a pattern of red pomegranates. Her appearance and dress strongly symbolize motherhood, fertility, and earthly abundance. On her head, she wears a radiant golden crown decorated with twelve stars. These twelve stars represent the twelve months and the complete cycles of nature. In her right hand, she gently holds a short golden scepter with a round orb on top. This scepter shows her gentle and nurturing authority over the natural world. Leaning against the bottom right of her throne is a copper shield shaped like a heart. Carved into the shield is the symbol of Venus. This highlights her connection to love and beauty. Right at her feet, a field of golden wheat stretches out. The ripe wheat represents a bountiful harvest and material success. In the background behind her, there is a dense green forest with a waterfall flowing into a river. This continuously flowing water represents an endless stream of life force and rich emotions.",
        "major-04": "The background of this card features harsh, towering red mountains with no plants in sight. These rugged mountains symbolize a tough reality and the need for strict structure. In the center, an older man sits upright on a rigid, gray stone throne. The throne is decorated with four carved ram heads on the armrests and the back. The ram heads represent the zodiac sign Aries, symbolizing leadership and authority. The man has a long, flowing white beard that reaches his chest. His beard shows his long years of experience and seasoned wisdom. He wears a heavy red robe, but underneath, cold metal armor is visible at his arms and legs. This armor indicates that he is a warrior, always ready to defend his rules and boundaries. On his head sits a heavy, solid gold crown. This crown establishes his supreme sovereignty. In his right hand, he grips an Ankh, which is a cross with a loop on top. In his left hand, he holds a golden orb. Together, these items represent his power and control over the physical world. At the very bottom, beneath his feet, a tiny, thin stream of water trickles by. This small amount of water suggests that he rules with cold reason and logic, rather than emotion.",
        "major-05": "In the center of the card, a religious figure sits on a throne between two thick, gray stone pillars. This setting represents a formal institution or a traditional belief system. He wears a tall, elaborate golden crown with three tiers. The three tiers symbolize his authority over the conscious, subconscious, and superconscious minds. In his left hand, he holds a golden staff with three crosses near the top. This staff reinforces his religious authority and spiritual leadership. His right hand is raised with two fingers pointing up and two pointing down. This gesture signifies a blessing and acts as a bridge between heaven and earth. At his feet, two large, crossed keys, one gold and one silver, rest on the ground. These keys represent the unlocking of spiritual secrets and hidden knowledge. Kneeling before him are two monks in robes, one wearing a red rose pattern and the other white lilies. These figures show followers seeking guidance and learning orthodox traditions.",
        "major-06": "At the top of the card, a large angel with majestic purple wings floats in a bright blue sky, with arms spread wide. This angel represents divine blessing and protection over the figures below. A massive, radiant yellow sun shines directly behind the angel. The sun symbolizes warmth, security, and the ultimate source of life. Below on the ground, a naked man and woman stand facing each other in a green, fertile landscape. Their nakedness represents complete vulnerability, truth, and innocence. Behind the woman on the left, a green apple tree grows with a snake wrapping around its trunk. This is the Tree of Knowledge, symbolizing earthly temptation and the complexities of choice. Behind the man on the right, a tree with twelve flame-like leaves reaches upward. This is the Tree of Life, representing passion and the twelve signs of the zodiac. In the very center background, a tall, smooth mountain rises into the sky. The mountain signifies a higher purpose and the challenges that relationships must overcome.",
        "major-07": "In the center, a strong warrior stands inside a stone chariot beneath a blue canopy decorated with white, six-pointed stars. This canopy represents the celestial world and his connection to the divine. The warrior wears silver armor, with crescent moon faces on his shoulders and a yellow square on his chest. These symbols indicate his earthly power and his mastery over shifting emotions. In his right hand, he holds a simple, upright wand. This wand shows that he controls his path through pure willpower and mental focus. In front of the chariot sit two sphinxes, one entirely black and the other entirely white. These sphinxes represent opposing forces, such as positive and negative, or conscious and unconscious minds. The warrior holds no reins, steering the creatures entirely by his command. This lack of reins emphasizes that true victory comes from self-discipline and internal control. Behind the chariot, a walled city sits quietly beneath a yellow sky. The city indicates that he is leaving the safety of the known world to pursue his ambitions.",
        "major-08": "In the center of this card, a woman with a gentle expression stands outdoors under a bright yellow sky. The yellow background radiates a sense of optimism, energy, and spiritual power. She is gently holding the jaws of a large, fierce adult lion with both of her hands. Her calm action shows that she is taming wild instincts through compassion and grace, rather than brute force. The woman wears a pure white dress decorated with a chain of green leaves and red roses around her waist and shoulders. The white dress stands for purity, while the roses represent the calming of earthly desires and passions. Above her head floats a yellow infinity symbol, shaped like a figure eight on its side. This symbol signifies endless spiritual power and infinite inner potential. The lion itself is colored in a vibrant reddish-orange. The beast represents raw, animalistic urges, courage, and intense human emotions. In the distant background, a peaceful green landscape and a blue mountain can be seen. This quiet scenery reinforces the theme of inner peace and emotional stability.",
        "major-09": "In the center, an elderly man with a long gray beard stands alone on the peak of a snowy, jagged mountain. The icy mountain peak represents his isolation, spiritual achievement, and elevation above worldly matters. He is wrapped in a long, hooded gray cloak that covers most of his body. This plain cloak symbolizes his withdrawal from society, turning his focus completely inward. In his raised right hand, he holds up a bright yellow lantern containing a glowing, six-pointed star. This lantern is the Star of David, representing divine light, ancient wisdom, and the inner guidance he uses to light his path. In his left hand, he leans heavily on a tall, straight wooden staff. The staff symbolizes his authority, stability, and the life experiences he uses to support himself. The background is entirely filled with a solid, dark gray sky without any other objects or people. This vast emptiness highlights his deep introspection, silence, and the solitary nature of his journey.",
        "major-10": "In the center of the sky floats a giant, orange wheel inscribed with mystical letters. This wheel represents the constant, unpredictable cycles of destiny and fortune. On top of the wheel sits a blue sphinx holding a sword. The sphinx symbolizes wisdom and the balance of life's mysteries. On the right side of the wheel, a red creature with the head of a jackal is falling downward. This figure is Anubis, representing the descent into misfortune or the underworld. On the left side, a golden snake is crawling downward. This snake stands for the descent of life force into the material world. In the four corners of the card sitting on clouds are four winged creatures: an angel, an eagle, a lion, and a bull. These creatures symbolize the four fixed signs of the zodiac and the stability of the universe amidst change. Each creature is reading a book. The books show that true wisdom comes through learning from life's continuous cycles.",
        "major-11": "In the center, a crowned figure sits rigidly on a stone throne between two solid gray pillars. This formal setting represents the strict, unyielding nature of truth and the law. The figure wears a heavy red robe over a green garment. The red shows active power and authority, while the green signifies the practical application of justice. In the figure's right hand, a double-edged silver sword is pointed straight up toward the sky. The upright sword symbolizes a clear, logical mind and the ability to cut through deception. In the left hand, the figure holds a perfectly balanced pair of golden scales. These scales represent the careful weighing of evidence and the need for fairness and equality. Behind the throne, a purple curtain hangs straight down. This curtain indicates the deep spiritual wisdom that guides true justice. A small white shoe peeks out from beneath the red robe. The white shoe suggests that the foundation of the figure's judgment is pure and unbiased.",
        "major-12": "In the center, a man hangs completely upside down from a wooden, T-shaped tree branch. This unusual position represents a willing surrender and the ability to see the world from a completely new perspective. He is suspended by his right ankle, while his left leg is crossed loosely behind his right knee. This posture forms the shape of an inverted number four, symbolizing a reversal of earthly values. His hands are hidden behind his back, making him completely defenseless. This lack of physical defense shows his total acceptance of his current situation. He wears a bright blue tunic and vibrant red pants. The blue represents deep spiritual contemplation, while the red signifies physical passion and endurance. Most importantly, a brilliant, glowing yellow halo surrounds his head. This radiant halo proves that his suspension is not a punishment, but a path to deep spiritual enlightenment and inner peace.",
        "major-13": "The main focus is a living skeleton wearing full black armor, riding slowly on a pale white horse. The skeleton in black armor symbolizes the inevitable, unstoppable force of endings and physical death. In its left hand, the skeleton holds a large black flag displaying a pure white, five-petaled rose. The black background represents the end of the old, while the white rose signifies beauty, purity, and the promise of a new beginning. Underneath the horse's hooves, a crowned king lies dead on the ground. The fallen king shows that death and transformation come to everyone, regardless of wealth or power. Standing before the horse, a bishop prays, a woman turns away, and a small child looks up with curiosity. These different reactions show the various ways humanity faces the unknown and the inevitable. In the far distance, a bright yellow sun is rising between two tall pillars. This distant sunrise promises that every ending is followed by a beautiful rebirth and a fresh start.",
        "major-14": "In the center, a large, majestic angel with vibrant red wings stands peacefully by a pool of water. The angel represents a divine messenger guiding humanity toward harmony and self-control. The angel has one bare foot stepping into the blue water and the other foot resting solidly on the green earth. This stance symbolizes the perfect balance between fluid emotions and solid, practical reality. The angel is holding two golden cups, carefully pouring a stream of water diagonally from one to the other. This action shows the blending of opposing forces to create a middle path of moderation and healing. The angel wears a simple white robe with a bright orange triangle enclosed in a white square on its chest. The white robe stands for purity, while the triangle inside the square symbolizes the spiritual rising above the material world. A bright golden halo shines around the angel's head, and a yellow iris flower grows nearby on the riverbank. The iris flower represents hope, while the glowing halo emphasizes the spiritual enlightenment gained through inner peace.",
        "major-15": "In the center of the dark card, a terrifying, goat-headed beast sits crouched on a large black cube. This monstrous figure, known as Baphomet, represents our primal, unhealthy urges and materialistic obsessions. The beast has large, leathery bat wings and an inverted pentagram carved into its forehead. These dark features symbolize the rejection of spiritual growth and a focus on earthly desires. In its raised right hand, the creature gives a mocking salute, while its left hand points a burning torch downward. The lowered torch signifies the destruction of life and the misuse of energy. Chained to the black cube below the beast are a naked man and woman with small horns and tails. Their animalistic features show that they have surrendered to their lowest instincts. Interestingly, the metal chains around their necks are quite loose and their hands are unbound. This loose chaining implies that they could easily escape their bondage, but they choose to remain trapped by their own ignorance and addictions.",
        "major-16": "Against a pitch-black night sky, a tall, gray stone tower stands on a rugged mountain peak. This imposing tower represents false beliefs, ego, and structures built on weak foundations. Suddenly, a massive, jagged bolt of yellow lightning strikes the top of the building. This powerful lightning bolt symbolizes a sudden, unavoidable revelation or a shocking disruption of the status quo. The impact of the strike violently knocks a large golden crown off the tower's roof. The falling crown shows the sudden collapse of arrogant leadership and the destruction of false pride. Bright red and yellow flames burst fiercely from the top and the three windows of the building. This uncontrollable fire signifies rapid transformation and the burning away of old, useless ideas. Two small figures, a man in a red cape and a woman in a blue dress, are falling headfirst from the burning tower toward the rocky ground. Their terrifying fall illustrates the sudden loss of control and the chaotic, painful process of radical change.",
        "major-17": "Under a calm, clear blue sky, a large, brilliant eight-pointed yellow star shines brightly in the center. This magnificent star represents ultimate hope, divine guidance, and spiritual healing. Surrounding the main star are seven smaller white stars, arranged in a quiet constellation. The seven smaller stars symbolize the opening of the seven chakras and the flow of cosmic energy. On the ground below, a naked woman kneels peacefully beside a small pool of blue water. Her complete nakedness reveals her absolute purity, truth, and vulnerability without any defenses. She holds two red jugs, pouring water from one into the pool and from the other onto the green grass. The water returning to the pool shows the replenishment of deep emotions, while the water watering the earth represents nourishing the physical world. In the background, a black ibis bird perches quietly on the branch of a leafy green tree. This sacred bird signifies the presence of ancient wisdom and thoughtful communication after a period of chaos.",
        "major-18": "High in the dark blue night sky, a large, yellow moon containing a human face looks down over the landscape. This mysterious moon represents intuition, illusions, and the hidden depths of the subconscious mind. Fifteen golden drops shaped like the letter Y are falling gently from the moon toward the earth. These falling drops symbolize spiritual energy and life force descending into the material realm. Below the moon, a tame white dog and a wild, dark wolf stand on opposite sides of a winding dirt path, howling upward. The dog and the wolf show the conflict between our civilized, controlled nature and our wild, animalistic instincts. In the foreground, a small crayfish is slowly crawling out of a dark pool of water onto the land. The emerging crayfish illustrates our deepest fears and hidden thoughts coming up to the surface of our awareness. The winding dirt path stretches far into the distance, passing between two distant stone towers. This long path suggests a confusing and uncertain journey through the dark, where things may not be as they seem.",
        "major-19": "A massive, brilliant yellow sun with a calm, human face dominates the entire upper half of the card. This radiant sun symbolizes absolute joy, vital energy, and the clear illumination of truth. Bright, straight, and wavy rays of light extend outward from the sun, filling the sky. These alternating rays represent the balance between direct action and gentle, flowing intuition. In the foreground, a joyful, naked young child rides confidently on a calm white horse. The child's nakedness indicates pure innocence and complete freedom from worldly burdens. The child stretches their arms wide while holding a long, vibrant red banner that flutters in the wind. This red banner is a symbol of dynamic life force, passion, and triumphant victory. Behind the child and the horse, four tall sunflowers bloom brightly over a solid gray brick wall. The blooming sunflowers represent growth and vitality, while the brick wall shows that past boundaries and limitations have been successfully overcome.",
        "major-20": "High up in the sky, a magnificent angel bursts through the clouds, blowing a long golden trumpet. This powerful figure is the Archangel Gabriel, representing a divine call, spiritual awakening, and a final reckoning. A small white square flag with a red cross hangs from the trumpet. This flag symbolizes the meeting of the physical and spiritual worlds, and the healing power of redemption. Down below, gray stone coffins float on the surface of a vast, calm blue ocean. The ocean represents the collective unconscious and the end of a long emotional journey. From inside these open coffins, pale men, women, and children are standing up with their arms raised toward the angel. The people rising from the dead illustrate a profound rebirth, absolution from past mistakes, and answering a higher calling. Their raised arms show their joyful readiness to be judged and to move forward into a completely new phase of existence.",
        "major-21": "In the center of the card, a joyful woman dances effortlessly in mid-air, wrapped only in a long, flowing purple scarf. Her dynamic dance represents the successful completion of a long journey and absolute freedom. She holds a white wand in each of her hands. The two wands show that she has achieved perfect balance and mastery over both the physical and spiritual realms. She is completely surrounded by a large, oval-shaped green wreath made of laurel leaves. This green wreath is a symbol of endless cycles, triumph, and eternal victory. The wreath is tied at the top and bottom with distinct red ribbons shaped like infinity signs. These infinite red ribbons emphasize that every ending is simply the beginning of a new, eternal cycle. In the four corners of the card float the heads of a man, an eagle, a lion, and a bull. These four figures represent the four fixed signs of the zodiac, signifying the stability, wholeness, and complete harmony of the universe.",
        "wands-01": "In the center, a glowing right hand reaches out from a gray cloud, gripping a thick wooden wand. The hand emerging from the cloud represents a divine gift or a sudden burst of inspiration. The wand itself has small green leaves sprouting from its wood. These green leaves symbolize new growth, fresh ideas, and raw creative potential. Below the hand, a peaceful landscape features a flowing blue river and green trees. This fertile ground shows that the environment is ready for a new beginning. In the distance, on top of a green hill, a gray castle stands proudly. The distant castle represents future goals and the solid achievements that can be built from this initial spark of energy. Small green leaves are falling through the air around the wand. These falling leaves indicate that spiritual energy is descending into the physical world, ready to be used.",
        "wands-02": "In the foreground, a man stands on the rooftop of a stone castle, looking out over a vast ocean. His high vantage point represents having a broad vision and making long-term plans. He wears a bright red tunic and a brown hat. The red tunic symbolizes his passion and ambition to explore. In his right hand, he holds a miniature globe of the world. The small globe shows that he has the world in his hands and is considering global or large-scale opportunities. His left hand rests on a tall wooden wand planted on the castle wall, while another wand is attached to the wall behind him. These two wands represent the solid foundation he has already built and the power he currently holds. Across the water, distant mountains meet the sky. The mountains indicate new challenges and territories waiting to be explored beyond his current comfort zone.",
        "wands-03": "A man stands firmly on a high cliff with his back turned to the viewer, gazing out at a golden sea. His forward-facing posture represents looking ahead to the future and anticipating the results of his hard work. He is wearing a striking red and green patterned cloak. The cloak's colors combine active passion with practical growth. He is leaning slightly on one tall wooden wand with his right hand, while two other wands stand firmly planted in the ground beside him. The three wands show that his initial plans have taken root and he now has a stable, reliable structure. Down below on the calm water, three sailing ships are slowly making their way across the sea. These ships symbolize commerce, expansion, and the successful journey of his projects returning to him. The sky is a bright, clear yellow, glowing with the light of a setting sun. This radiant sky emphasizes optimism and successful expansion.",
        "wands-04": "In the center, a beautiful canopy made of fresh flowers and green vines is tied to the tops of four tall wooden wands planted in the ground. This floral canopy and the four sturdy wands represent a solid foundation, a happy home, and a safe environment. Through the frame of the wands, two joyful people in the background are raising bouquets of flowers high in the air. Their celebratory poses symbolize a happy homecoming, a community celebration, or a major milestone achieved. They are wearing simple, flowing white and red robes, showing a mix of purity and joyful passion. Behind the celebrating figures, a large, secure stone castle with a red roof stands under a brilliant yellow sky. The castle and the bright sky reinforce the feeling of deep security, peace, and ultimate satisfaction after a period of hard work. The foreground is clear and inviting, welcoming the viewer to join the celebration.",
        "wands-05": "The card is filled with five young men who are actively raising and crossing large wooden wands against each other. Their chaotic, uncoordinated movements represent conflict, competition, and a clash of different ideas. Each man is wearing a brightly colored tunic in distinct colors like red, green, blue, and yellow. These different outfits signify their diverse backgrounds, unique perspectives, and opposing opinions. They are standing on uneven, patchy green ground, which adds to the feeling of instability and a lack of solid footing. Despite the raised wands, none of the men appear to be striking each other directly, and there are no signs of injury. This lack of actual harm suggests that the conflict is more like an intense brainstorming session, a friendly rivalry, or a chaotic struggle to be heard, rather than a deadly battle. The bright blue sky behind them indicates that once the dust settles, clear communication is still possible.",
        "wands-06": "In the center, a confident man rides a proud white horse through a cheering crowd of people. The white horse represents purity, strength, and successful progress. He is wearing a bright green laurel wreath on his head. This green wreath is a classic symbol of victory and public recognition. In his right hand, he holds a tall wooden wand that also has a laurel wreath tied to its top. This decorated wand shows his personal achievement and leadership. The crowd around him is holding five other wands upright. These raised wands signify the support and admiration of his community. He wears a yellow tunic and a green cloak. The yellow tunic symbolizes his radiant energy and optimism, while the green cloak highlights his practical growth. The clear blue sky above confirms a peaceful and triumphant atmosphere.",
        "wands-07": "A man stands defensively on a high, grassy hill, forcefully holding a thick wooden wand with both hands. His elevated position represents having the high ground and a strong, righteous stance. Six other wands are thrusting upward at him from below the edge of the hill. These rising wands symbolize fierce competition, sudden challenges, or opposing viewpoints trying to knock him down. The man is wearing a green tunic and, interestingly, two mismatched shoes, one shoe and one boot. This uneven footwear indicates that he was caught off guard and had to defend himself in a hurry. Despite the surprise attack, his face shows fierce determination. His strong posture shows that he is ready to hold his boundaries and protect his hard-earned success. The plain blue sky behind him keeps the focus entirely on his solitary struggle.",
        "wands-08": "Unlike most cards, there are no human figures in this scene; instead, eight wooden wands are flying diagonally through the air from left to right. This synchronized movement represents swift action, sudden changes, and fast-paced communication. The wands are all sprouting green leaves as they fly. These green leaves symbolize fresh ideas and living, dynamic energy in motion. They are travelling together in perfect alignment against a clear, bright blue sky. This orderly flight shows that all efforts are moving smoothly toward a single, focused goal without any obstacles. Below the flying wands, a peaceful landscape features a calm, winding river and gentle green hills. This quiet earth below emphasizes that the rapid changes happening above are natural and unhindered. The wands appear to be descending, indicating that the results of these rapid events will land very soon.",
        "wands-09": "In the center, a tired but alert man leans heavily on a tall wooden wand, holding it tightly with both hands. His tense grip represents his deep resilience and his determination to keep fighting. He has a white bandage wrapped around his head. This bandage shows that he has already been through difficult battles and has suffered injuries, but he is still standing. Behind him, eight other wands are planted firmly in the ground, forming a tight fence. This wooden barricade symbolizes the strong boundaries he has built to protect himself from further harm. He wears a red tunic, which highlights his remaining passion and survival instinct. He is looking over his shoulder with a suspicious and guarded expression. This watchful gaze indicates that he expects more challenges, but he is fully prepared to defend his position until the very end.",
        "wands-10": "A man is walking away from the viewer, carrying a heavy, awkward bundle of ten thick wooden wands in his arms. The massive bundle completely blocks his vision and bends his back forward. This heavy load represents overwhelming burdens, taking on too much responsibility, and physical exhaustion. His posture is strained as he slowly makes his way toward a distant town with a large castle. The distant town symbolizes his final goal and the reason he is enduring this painful labor. He wears a bright red tunic and orange boots, colors that show he still has the raw energy and willpower to finish the job. The wands are fanned out in front of him, making them difficult to balance. This awkward arrangement shows the stress of managing too many tasks at once. However, the clear blue sky suggests that once he reaches the town, this difficult cycle will finally end.",
        "wands-11": "In the center, a young man stands confidently, holding a long wooden wand planted on the ground with both hands. His upward gaze toward the tip of the wand represents his fascination with a new idea or a sudden creative spark. He wears a bright yellow tunic patterned with black salamanders. The salamanders symbolize the element of fire and the ability to grow through challenges. Interestingly, the salamanders' mouths are not closed, meaning his potential is still developing. He also wears a hat with a small red feather, showing his youthful passion and eagerness to learn. Behind him, a dry, sandy desert stretches out toward three small mountains shaped like pyramids in the distance. This barren but expansive landscape indicates that he is at the very beginning of a long, ambitious journey into the unknown.",
        "wands-12": "The card features a knight in full metal armor riding a fiercely rearing orange horse. The dynamic, upward movement of the horse symbolizes explosive energy, hasty action, and an unstoppable drive to move forward. The knight holds a thick wooden wand firmly in his right hand, ready for adventure. Over his armor, he wears a bright yellow tunic decorated with a pattern of black salamanders. Unlike the Page's tunic, these salamanders are biting their own tails, representing a more complete and focused cycle of fiery energy. From his helmet, a long, vibrant red plume blows wildly in the wind. This fiery red feather highlights his burning passion and bold courage. The background is a dry, barren desert with three uneven pyramids in the distance, emphasizing his desire to conquer distant, challenging lands.",
        "wands-13": "In the center, a confident queen sits upright on a stone throne decorated with carved lions and blooming sunflowers. The lions represent raw strength and the element of fire, while the sunflowers symbolize radiant joy and a positive, life-giving nature. She holds a tall wooden wand in her right hand and a large, fresh sunflower in her left. This balanced pose shows that she controls her passionate energy with warmth and nurturing care. She wears a bright yellow dress and a white cloak, colors that reflect her vibrant optimism and pure intentions. Her golden crown is subtly shaped like small flames, indicating her mastery over her own willpower. At her feet, a small black cat sits quietly, looking forward. The black cat introduces a grounded sense of mystery, sharp intuition, and independent feminine power.",
        "wands-14": "A mature king sits comfortably on a solid throne decorated with carvings of roaring lions and salamanders biting their tails. These carvings represent his absolute, mature mastery over fire, strength, and infinite creative energy. He holds a thick wooden wand securely in his right hand, resting it on the ground. This grounded wand shows that his passion is controlled, steady, and used for practical leadership. He wears a bright orange cape over a yellow robe, and his golden crown is styled to look like blazing, upward-pointing flames. These fiery colors and shapes symbolize his bold authority, visionary mindset, and intense charisma. Near his left foot, a small, live salamander crawls peacefully on the ground. This living creature emphasizes that his fiery nature is fully integrated into his life, bringing warmth and stability rather than destruction.",
        "cups-01": "In the center, a glowing right hand reaches out from a gray cloud, holding a large golden cup. The hand and cloud represent a divine gift of emotional and spiritual energy. From the brim of the cup, five distinct streams of pure water overflow continuously. These five streams symbolize the five senses being overwhelmed by deep feelings and spiritual awakening. Below the cup, the water falls into a calm, wide pond filled with blooming green lotus leaves and pink flowers. This lush pond shows the fertile, peaceful nature of the human soul. A pure white dove is diving directly into the golden cup, carrying a small, round wafer marked with a cross in its beak. The dove and wafer signify divine love, peace, and the pure descent of spiritual blessings into the physical world.",
        "cups-02": "In the center, a young man and woman stand facing each other, each gently holding a large golden cup. Their balanced, forward-facing posture represents a harmonious partnership, mutual attraction, and deep emotional connection. They are dressed in colorful, flowing garments of red, white, and blue, blending passion, purity, and calm emotions. Right above their cups, a red lion's head floats between two large golden wings, attached to a vertical staff wrapped with two snakes. This winged symbol is the Caduceus, representing healing, passionate energy, and a divine blessing upon their union. In the background, a peaceful green landscape rolls out toward a quiet, distant house. This steady, safe environment indicates that their relationship is built on a solid, comforting foundation.",

        "cups-04": "A young man sits alone on a green, grassy hillside, resting his back heavily against the trunk of a large tree. His crossed arms and downturned gaze represent deep apathy, dissatisfaction, and a strong desire to withdraw from the outside world. Directly in front of him, three golden cups stand neatly in a row on the grass. These three cups symbolize his past emotional experiences or his current feeling of stagnation and boredom. Next to him, a glowing hand reaches out from a gray floating cloud, offering a fourth golden cup right in front of his face. This magically appearing cup indicates a brand new opportunity or a fresh emotional connection that is completely available to him. However, because he refuses to look up, he is completely ignoring this hidden blessing.",

This dark, heavy clothing and lowered posture represent deep grief, regret, and a period of painful mourning. Directly in front of the figure, three golden cups lie knocked over on the ground, spilling red and green liquid onto the earth. These fallen cups symbolize emotional loss, disappointment, and an intense focus on what went wrong in the past. Unnoticed behind the figure's back, two more golden cups stand perfectly upright and full. These standing cups show that there is still hope, remaining love, and hidden blessings left in their life, if only they would turn around. In the background, a sturdy stone bridge crosses a flowing river, leading to a distant castle, suggesting a clear path to healing and moving forward.",

This unidentifiable figure represents anyone facing overwhelming choices, deep confusion, or losing themselves in daydreams. Resting softly on top of the cloud are seven large golden cups, each containing a completely different, magical vision. These floating cups symbolize wishful thinking, grand illusions, and the tempting but unstable nature of the imagination. Starting from the left, the cups hold a beautiful human face, a glowing draped figure, a dangerous green snake, a tall stone castle, a glittering pile of jewels, a green laurel wreath, and a fierce red dragon. These diverse items represent a wide range of human desires such as love, spiritual enlightenment, deceit, security, wealth, victory, and dark temptations. The cloudy foundation beneath all the cups warns that none of these choices are grounded in solid reality yet.",
        "cups-08": "In the foreground, eight golden cups are neatly stacked in two rows, five on the bottom and three on the top, leaving a noticeable empty gap. This stacked arrangement shows an emotionally stable life that has been built over time, yet the missing cup signifies a deep, lingering feeling of dissatisfaction or emptiness. Behind the cups, a man wearing a heavy red cloak is walking away, leaning on a tall wooden staff. His purposeful departure represents leaving behind a comfortable but unfulfilling situation to search for higher spiritual meaning. He is heading toward a harsh, rocky mountain range under the cover of a dark night. The rugged mountains symbolize the challenging, solitary journey of self-discovery that lies ahead.

She is looking intensely at a large, highly elaborate golden cup with a closed lid, holding it carefully with both hands. The closed lid signifies that her deepest feelings, psychic abilities, and spiritual thoughts are kept private and well-protected. She wears a flowing white dress under a soft blue cloak, creating an image of purity, tranquility, and deep emotional wisdom.

Together, the cup and scepter show his mastery over both his compassionate feelings and his worldly authority. He wears a soft blue tunic under a heavy golden cape, combining deep emotional intuition with visible, confident leadership. His calm, steady gaze looks forward, completely undisturbed by the moving waves around him. In the background on his right, a small fish jumps happily out of the water, while on his left, a red sailing ship rides the waves.

She has both arms crossed tightly over her chest, holding two heavy silver swords pointing outward in opposite directions. This defensive, closed-off posture symbolizes a painful stalemate, blocked emotions, and a desperate attempt to protect her heart from making a difficult decision. Behind her, a rocky, treacherous coastline meets a vast, dark body of water. The calm but dangerous water indicates hidden, unexpressed emotions swirling beneath her frozen exterior. High in the dark sky, a sharp yellow crescent moon hangs quietly. The crescent moon highlights the role of intuition and the hidden, subconscious fears that are currently keeping her trapped in this standoff.",
        "swords-03": "The central image of this card is a large, vibrant red heart floating entirely on its own in the middle of a gloomy, gray sky. This floating heart represents the core of human emotion, deep love, and vulnerability. Piercing aggressively straight through the heart are three sharp silver swords, crossing each other in the center. These three swords symbolize a sudden, intense heartbreak, deep emotional pain, and the sharp sting of betrayal, grief, or harsh words. There are no human figures present to distract from this singular image of profound sorrow. In the background, thick, dark gray storm clouds completely fill the sky, pouring down heavy, continuous lines of freezing rain. The relentless storm and the dark clouds reflect a period of overwhelming sadness, emotional release, and the necessary, cleansing tears that follow a painful but undeniable realization of the truth.",
        "swords-04": "Inside a quiet, dimly lit stone church, a golden statue of a knight lies perfectly still on top of a stone tomb. The resting knight represents a period of necessary rest, deep meditation, and recovery after a period of intense mental stress or conflict. His hands are pressed together in a peaceful gesture of prayer on his chest. This praying posture shows an inward focus and a calm surrender to healing. One long silver sword lies flat directly beneath him, carved into the side of the tomb. This single resting sword symbolizes a singular, focused thought and a mind that is currently at peace. On the gray stone wall above him, three other swords hang pointing straight down toward his head and chest. These hanging swords represent the past troubles and mental anxieties that have been temporarily set aside.

        "swords-05": "In the foreground, a young man stands with a smug, self-satisfied smirk on his face, looking back over his left shoulder. His arrogant expression represents a hollow victory, selfishness, and winning an argument at the cost of relationships. He is holding three silver swords, casually resting two of them against his left shoulder while the third points to the ground. Scattered on the green grass near his feet are two more dropped swords. These abandoned weapons symbolize the surrender and defeat of his opponents. In the background, two distant figures with their backs turned are walking away slowly, their heads hung low in deep sorrow. The retreating figures show the emotional damage, alienation, and loss caused by a ruthless, win-at-all-costs mentality. Above them, jagged, fast-moving gray clouds completely tear across the sky. These chaotic, sharp clouds reflect the lingering tension, hostile atmosphere, and the destructive mental energy that still fills the air.",
        "swords-06": "In the center, a person stands at the back of a small wooden boat, using a long black pole to push it across the water. This steady paddling represents a slow, deliberate journey away from a difficult situation. Huddled in the front of the boat, a figure heavily wrapped in a cloak sits next to a small child. Their covered, bowed posture symbolizes a state of deep sorrow, seeking refuge, and carrying the heavy emotional baggage of the past. Sticking straight up from the wooden floor of the boat are six silver swords. These upright swords show that while they are moving forward, the painful memories and sharp thoughts of the past are still traveling with them. Notice the water around them: the water on the right side of the boat is dark and choppy, representing the turbulent times they are leaving behind. Ahead of them on the left, the water is smooth and calm, indicating that they are heading toward a much more peaceful and stable future. In the distance, a quiet coastline with gray trees promises a safe harbor and a chance for mental recovery.",
        "swords-07": "In the foreground, a man is carefully tiptoeing away from a military camp, glancing back over his left shoulder with a confident smirk. His stealthy movement and backward glance represent deception, hidden motives, and attempting to get away with something in secret. He is awkwardly carrying five silver swords in his arms, holding them tightly to his chest. This clumsy bundle symbolizes taking what doesn't belong to him, using cunning strategy instead of direct confrontation, and acting out of self-interest. Behind him, two other swords remain planted firmly in the yellow ground near a group of brightly colored tents. The two left-behind swords and the distant camp show that his victory is incomplete, and his deceitful actions may soon be discovered by others. The sky is a bright, clear yellow, which strangely contrasts with his dark, sneaky behavior. This bright sky highlights that his actions are actually happening in broad daylight, suggesting that his secrets and lies will eventually be brought out into the open for everyone to see.",
        "swords-08": "In the center, a woman stands alone on muddy, uneven ground, completely surrounded by a circular fence of eight silver swords planted firmly in the earth. Her isolated position represents a feeling of being hopelessly trapped, restricted by circumstances, and overwhelmed by anxiety. She wears a long red dress, but her arms are loosely bound to her body with thick bandages, and a blindfold covers her eyes. These bindings symbolize a strong victim mentality and a self-imposed inability to see a clear way out. However, the bandages are actually quite loose, and the swords do not form a complete cage. This indicates that her prison is mostly in her own mind, and she has the personal power to simply step away if she chooses to open her eyes. At her feet, small pools of water mix with the muddy earth, showing that her deep emotional fears are muddying her logical thoughts. High on a distant gray cliff behind her, a large castle stands safely out of reach, representing the solid security and freedom that she currently believes is completely impossible to achieve.",

This desperate, terrified posture represents overwhelming anxiety, deep depression, and the terrifying grip of intense nightmares. Their face is completely hidden, showing deep shame, unbearable worry, and an inability to face the harsh realities of the waking world. Directly behind them, nine long silver swords are mounted horizontally on the pitch-black wall, stacked one above the other. These heavy, looming swords symbolize the sharp, racing thoughts, deep regrets, and mental anguish that constantly hang over their head, preventing any peaceful rest. The bed is covered with a thick blanket decorated with red roses and astrological symbols, while the wooden base features a carving of a duel. The roses and symbols show that while they are actually safe in the physical world, their mind is completely consumed by internal battles and exaggerated fears. The solid black background emphasizes the suffocating, isolating nature of extreme mental distress.",
        "swords-10": "A man lies completely flat on his stomach on the cold ground, facing away from the viewer. His lifeless posture represents an absolute ending, a painful defeat, and hitting rock bottom. Sticking violently into his back, from his head down to his legs, are ten silver swords. This excessive number of swords symbolizes a brutal overkill, a devastating betrayal, and a sudden, completely unavoidable tragedy. He wears a bright red cape that drapes over his lower body, highlighting the deep passion and life force that has now been tragically lost. The sky above him is a heavy, suffocating pitch black, reflecting the darkest moment of despair and the complete end of a difficult cycle. However, in the distant background, beyond a completely still, calm blue sea, a brilliant yellow sunrise is just beginning to break the horizon.

The Page wears a light yellow tunic and red leggings, combining an energetic mind with passionate physical energy. Their hair is blowing wildly in the wind, matching the chaotic, fast-moving gray clouds in the sky above. This windy environment indicates a sudden rush of new ideas, rapid communication, and a restless intellect. A flock of black birds flies chaotically through the turbulent sky. These scattered birds represent scattered thoughts, sudden news, or the bustling energy of a busy mind constantly seeking information.",

Over his armor, he wears a red cape that flies wildly behind him, catching the strong wind. This blowing red cape symbolizes his intense, burning passion and the sheer force of his intellectual drive. The horse's harness is decorated with images of birds and butterflies, linking his earthly speed to the element of air and swift communication. In the background, jagged, storm-tossed trees bend deeply under the force of a powerful gale, and jagged gray clouds tear across the sky. This turbulent, windy landscape shows that his aggressive approach often creates chaos and disrupts the peace around him.",
        "swords-13": "A stern, elegant queen sits upright on a high stone throne under a mostly clear, bright blue sky.

This gesture indicates that she is open to communication but demands absolute truth and respect. She wears a white robe under a light blue cloak, highlighting her pure intentions and cool, detached emotional state. A single bird flies high above, emphasizing her independent and solitary nature.",
        "swords-14": "A mature king sits calmly on a solid stone throne, facing directly forward with a serious, composed expression. His steady, unwavering posture represents intellectual authority, ultimate fairness, and the masterful control of his own mind. His throne is decorated with subtle carvings of butterflies and crescent moons. These carvings symbolize his deep mental transformation and his ability to balance cold logic with underlying intuition. He holds a long, double-edged silver sword in his right hand, slightly tilted to the side.

These two figures symbolize spiritual guidance and strategic planning coming together to support the physical work. The three individuals are engaged in a deep, respectful discussion, illustrating the power of teamwork, collaboration, and combining different talents to achieve a shared goal.

Another pentacle balances precariously on top of his golden crown, dominating his thoughts, while his two feet press firmly down on two more coins to secure them to the earth. This incredibly defensive, locked-down posture symbolizes hoarding, extreme possessiveness, and a complete obsession with material wealth at the expense of emotional freedom.

The harsh, snowy environment represents severe material hardship, physical illness, and a period of deep financial or emotional poverty. The first figure is a man leaning heavily on wooden crutches, with a bell tied around his neck, looking down at the icy ground. The second figure is hunched over, wrapped tightly in a thin, worn-out blanket to block the biting wind. Their barefoot, injured state symbolizes utter destitution, vulnerability, and the feeling of being completely left out in the cold. Right beside them on the dark brick wall is a large, brilliantly glowing stained-glass window featuring five golden pentacles.
